<h2> How (and Why) I Started Making Robots for AI Research </h2>

<p> 
In January of 2015 I had just finished an exciting internship at a robotics company, and was starting a graduate course as a way of seeing if grad school was the right fit for me. This period of time was a little up-in-the-air, as earlier that year I had come off of a year-long foray into wearable technology (including my own startup). One big realization I had during that time was that certain technical development can't be rushed in the form of a startup, especially considering real-life financing constraints. Grad school means you get to work on interesting technical problems while getting to tell people that you're actually doing something. Sounds pretty good, but was it for me? 
</p>

<p>
I figured taking a course with a substantive research project might be a decent way of finding out, without committing a whole 2+ years. The course I took was convex optimization, and my objective (no pun intended) was to continue learning advanced mathematical methods, and see how they could be applied to robotic motion control. Basically I was indulging my interests based on previous experiences. This was also my way of further angling my skillset towards a future that will be shaped by artificial intelligence. 
</p>

<p>
While I'm not necessarily an academic, it was the research work in this course that got me excited about robotic platforms for artificial intelligence. The work I came up with in the final month of the course was titled "Motion Trajectory Generation for Robotic Manipulators via Sequential Convex Optimization." The big idea was to leverage known efficient algorithms into a framework that could approximate the solution of generalized manipulator control problems. For example, how do I move the arm from point A in space to point B while avoiding this obstacle in the way? And how can I do this for a standard 6-DOF articulated arm, or some 14-DOF "snake"-type arm like the hilarious Tesla autonomous charging prototype? 

</p>
The research went fairly well for only a month of exploration work, and I got a simple 5-DOF arm model (of the Nao robot) to use my algorithm to generate a motion path avoiding a large ball obstacle. What really interested me though was the process of software simulation in robotics research, and how... artificial it seemed. Now technically the physics checks out and it makes sense. And we know simulation is used heavily in industry. But what a world of difference it might make if this type of algorithm development and iteration occurred on real robots. Then they'd have to account for real imperfections. And random objects in the lab could spark new application ideas, and iteration would happen quickly, and not require creating a realistic model of something as trivial as a plastic cup. 
<p>

<p>
I wanted a research robot, and knew I couldn't be the only one. And why, during all my time at U of T engineering, had I not seen one, let alone see one being programmed and used? After an extensive market survey, I saw there was no affordable and high quality robot for research purposes. You get toys for $500 and less (very small, shaky, and weak), still limited though somewhat better in the $3K - $10K range, then industrial quality at $25K+. This was enough to motivate me to start saving up paychecks and moonlighting with robotic hardware experimentation. Then I started researching out to researchers and professors across Canada, and it really did seem like a niche existed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>So for the past two years I've been learning how to make industrial quality robots, for an order of magnitude lower cost.</b> Instead of a $50K robot arm, researchers (and even hobbyists) should be able to get something closer to $5K. It should be very easy to program, be precise and strong, be modular, and incorporate various sensors relevant to current AI research. I started another startup because it seemed to be the most efficient way to direct capital. Initially I started with $8K of my own savings, and now have been through 5 major design iterations, with incredible gains each time. Along the way the team has grown to include quite a few interns, both past and present, that are super excited about the mission of making robots for AI research.  
</p>

<p>
Some highlights for me have included building and managing a small team, going to China to meet with component suppliers (and interrupting a vacation), learning how to weld, creating a robotic welding demonstration, and taking part in the Aerospace school's entrepreneurship grant program. As well, learning more about researchers across the country and what they'd look for in a new robotic research platform, and learning what's missing in what's already out there. During the process last summer I met Professor Sanja Fidler from U of T, and now we've officially started the process of applying to a grant together that would provide funds for us to deliver a robotic prototype!
</p> 

<p>  
Back to the mission: while I started this process two years ago with the exploratory goal of learning "why are (good) robots so damn expensive", I came to gain a greater appreciation for why this would be important work. And why I've continued to follow this path for this amount of time, and will continue to do so. The fact of the matter is that enabling AI research through affordable high quality hardware will probably have a much greater impact than me going to grad school and grinding away at my own individual research. Not that I don't have faith in myself being able to come up with interesting work. It's just that I realize how much more could be accomplished if even a few dozen labs around North America had a standardized robot platform for AI research, vs. having to live in simulation land.  
</p>

<p>
Here's why it makes more sense to me. First of all, it means more people working on AI research. Quantity matters, especially in the earlier days when research is more exploratory and people are "throwing darts at the board" so to speak. Secondly, there's standardization. There's sharing of software. Want to know what it currently looks like? A team at Stanford designs and builds their own scrappy arm with parts from Home Depot, doesn't release the hardware design, makes custom software to control it, writes a paper, and that's that. Now imagine if we had a robot platform at multiple schools where software from one could easily be uploaded and tested on the other. Platforms like the Baxter robot start to get at this, but they still don't deliver the highest quality or right form factor at a reasonable price. We have a great comparison chart here with our early platform: http://www.bigsolverobotics.com/apollo.html#compare 
</p>

<p>
Think of it like the software revolution. We didn't get smart and productive software until computers became affordable and accessible enough to lots of hackers and developers. Why wouldn't the same be true of robotics and AI? Instead of thinking about any one particular software advance to make robotics intelligent, I like to think about the whole overall system. It's the researchers and developers that will be doing the most important work. So a very high leverage activity would be to support them.
</p>

<p>
And I look forward to doing my part towards that end. I believe a startup company can be the most effective vehicle with which to perform this. Why? Because you get to focus deeply on something new that nobody else is really caring too much about. After all, it's not a huge initial market (there's about 4K universities in North America that may do this type of research). You also get to dig into individual customers' concerns and tailor it right for this small initial market. And gaining expertise in building robots and working with AI researchers and software developers is incredibly rewarding itself.
